Description: Tests whether the linear hypothesis of a model
    is correct specified using Dominguez-Lobato test. Also Ramsey's RESET test is 
    implemented and Wald tests can be carry out. Although RESET test is widely used to 
    test the linear hypothesis of a model, Dominguez and Lobato (2019) proposed a novel 
    approach that generalize well known specification tests such as Ramsey's. This test 
    relies on wild-bootstrap and this package implements this approach in a general way, 
    being compatible with any function that fits linear models and is compatible with 
    the 'update' function such as 'stats::lm', 'lfe::felm' and 'forecast::Arima' (for ARMA models). Also 
    the package can handle custom statistics such as 'Cramer von Mises' and 'Kolmogorov 
    Smirnov', described by the authors, and custom distributions such as 'Mammen' (discrete 
    and continuous) and 'Rademacher'.
